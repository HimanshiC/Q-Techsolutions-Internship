# Q-Techsolutions-Internship
This repository contains  a collection of projects completed during my internship at Q TechSolutions. It demonstrates my ability to apply my knowledge of data science to real life application. The language used is python and they are done in juupyter notebook.
The list of projects which are to be completed is as follows-

## *1.Data Cleaning on Retail Dataset*
- Input: CSV file with columns (OrderID, ProductName, Price, Quantity, Total,  OrderDate)
- Output: Cleaned dataset with missing values filled and outliers removed.
- Details: Handle missing data, standardize column formats, remove duplicates, and  identify outliers.

## *2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Sales Data*
- Input: CSV file with columns (Region, Sales, Profit, Category).
- Output: Summary statistics and visualizations (bar charts, histograms).
- Details: Perform descriptive statistics and use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for  visualization.

## *3. Sentiment Analysis on Tweets*
- Input: CSV file with columns (TweetID, Text, Timestamp).
- Output: Sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) for each tweet.
- Details: Use text processing libraries to clean tweets and a simple model like Logistic Regression for classification.

## *4. Linear Regression for House Price Prediction*
- Input: Dataset with columns (Size, Location, Age, Price).
- Output: Predicted house prices.
- Details: Build a linear regression model and evaluate using RMSE.

## *5.Weather Data Visualization*
- Input: CSV file with columns (Date, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall).
- Output: Line and scatter plots showing weather trends.
- Details: Parse dates, handle missing data, and use visualization libraries for trends.

## *6.Customer Segmentation using K-Means*
- Input: Dataset with columns (CustomerID, Age, Income, SpendingScore).
- Output: Customer segments labeled by clusters.
- Details: Standardize data, determine optimal clusters using the Elbow Method, and visualize results.

## *7.Time Series Analysis for Stock Prices*
- Input: Historical stock price data with columns (Date, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume).
- Output: Predicted stock prices for the next week/month.
- Details: Apply ARIMA or Prophet model for predictions and visualize trends.

## *8.Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
- Input: Image dataset (e.g., MNIST for digits or CIFAR-10 for objects).
- Output: Predicted categories for input images.
- Details: Preprocess images, train a CNN, and evaluate accuracy.

## *9.Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions*
- Input: Transaction dataset with columns (TransactionID, Amount, Location, Time, FraudFlag).
- Output: Model to classify transactions as fraud or not fraud.
- Details: Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) and evaluate metrics like precision and recall.

## *10.Churn Prediction for a Subscription Service*
- Input: Dataset with customer details (CustomerID, Age, Tenure, Usage, IsChurned).
- Output: Probability of customer churn.
- Details: Use logistic regression or decision trees and generate actionable insights.

## *11.Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Chatbot Development*
- Input: Dataset with intents (tags, patterns, responses).
- Output: A functional chatbot capable of responding to queries.
- Details: Use pre-trained embeddings, build an intent classifier, and implement dialogue flow.

## *12.Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO*
- Input: Video or live camera feed.
- Output: Annotated frames with detected objects.
- Details: Train a YOLO model or use pre-trained weights to detect objects in real-time.

## *13.Recommendation System for E-commerce*
- Input: Dataset with user ratings (UserID, ProductID, Rating, Timestamp).
- Output: Recommended products for each user.
- Details: Implement collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques.

## *14.Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines*
- Input: Sensor data with columns (MachineID, Timestamp, SensorReadings).
- Output: Predictions for machine failures.
- Details: Build a model using anomaly detection or time series analysis.

## *15.Autonomous Driving Simulation*
- Input: Labeled driving dataset with sensor and image data.
- Output: Path planning and control signals for driving.
- Details: Use reinforcement learning or computer vision for control systems

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn for data manipulation and modeling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development
